# Arithmetic Operators:

# Addition (+): Adds two numbers.
# Python
# result = 5 + 3
# print(result)  # Output: 8
# Use code with caution.

# Subtraction (-): Subtracts one number from another.
# Python
# result = 10 - 4
# print(result)  # Output: 6
# Use code with caution.

# Multiplication (*): Multiplies two numbers.
# Python
# result = 3 * 7
# print(result)  # Output: 21
# Use code with caution.

# Division (/): Divides one number by another.
# Python
# result = 15 / 3
# print(result)  # Output: 5.0
# Use code with caution.

# Floor Division (//): Divides two numbers and returns the integer quotient.
# Python
# result = 17 // 3
# print(result)  # Output: 5
# Use code with caution.

# Modulo (%): Returns the remainder of the division.
# Python
# result = 17 % 3
# print(result)  # Output: 2
# Use code with caution.

# Exponentiation (**): Raises a number to a power.
# Python
# result = 2 ** 3
# print(result)  # Output: 8
# Use code with caution.

# Comparison Operators:

# Equal to (==): Checks if two values are equal.
# Python
# result = 5 == 5
# print(result)  # Output: True
# Use code with caution.

# Not equal to (!=): Checks if two values are not equal.
# Python
# result = 5 != 3
# print(result)  # Output: True
# Use code with caution.

# Greater than (>): Checks if the left operand is greater than the right operand.
# Python
# result = 7 > 3
# print(result)  # Output: True
# Use code with caution.

# Less than (<): Checks if the left operand is less than the right operand.
# Python
# result = 2 < 5
# print(result)  # Output: True
# Use code with caution.

# Greater than or equal to (>=): Checks if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand.
# Python
# result = 6 >= 6
# print(result)  # Output: True
# Use code with caution.

# Â  
# Less than or equal to (<=): Checks if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand.
# Python
# result = 4 <= 7
# print(result)  # Output: True
# Use code with caution.

# Logical Operators:

# And (and): Returns True if both operands are True.
# Python
# result = True and False
# print(result)  # Output: False
# Use code with caution.

# Or (or): Returns True if at least one operand is True.
# Python
# result = True or False
# print(result)  # Output: True
# Use code with caution.

# Not (not): Negates the boolean value of an operand.
# Python
# result = not True
# print(result)  # Output: False
# Use code with caution.

# Membership Operators:

# In (in): Checks if a value is present in a sequence.
# Python
# my_list = [1, 2, 3]
# result = 2 in my_list
# print(result)  # Output: True
# Use code with caution.

# Not in (not in): Checks if a value is not present in a sequence.
# Python
# my_string = "hello"
# result = "z" not in my_string
# print(result)  # Output: True
# Use code with caution.

# Identity Operators:

# Is (is): Checks if two objects are the same object in memory.
# Python
# x = 5
# y = 5
# result = x is y
# print(result)  # Output: True
# Use code with caution.

# Is not (is not): Checks if two objects are not the same object in memory.
# Python
# x = [1, 2, 3]
# y = [1, 2, 3]
# result = x is not y
# print(result)  # Output: True
